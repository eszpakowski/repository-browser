# Read Me First
Sample REST API used for browsing through GitHub code repositories and later possibly other services.

## Requirements
To build and run the application you need the following:
- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.interview.repositorybrowser.RepositoryBrowserApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
