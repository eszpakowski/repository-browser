Potential improvements:
- add web security as well as GitHub authentication (to get over the throttling limit)
- add pagination to result handling (important if repository search returns more than 100 results)
- extract constants like GitHub URLs to application.properties file
- improve exception handling for async calls (if only some of the requests fail we should produce a report containing
status of each of the queries)
